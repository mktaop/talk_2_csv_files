#Talk to your CSV files!

Using text to sql, sqlite3, and Gemini 2.0, you can chat with your data stored in a CSV file(s)!! & Visualize your data!!

Primary thing I learned was that providing field decsription helps.  Use the code I provided to help create one and then plug that schema in my app.py code, basically replace the schema i currently have in there.

Text to SQL is still a challenging task, even when using a powerful model like Gemini 2.0.  So if your code errors out, try playing around with your prompt.  Also, play around with sys_message in get_query function to improve query creation.  Think about the right examples to provide in sys_message tailored to your file and needs.

Good luck!  Hope you take what I started and make it even better!!!

Please consider give this repo a star if you found my code/video helpful.
